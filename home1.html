        <h1>7 Gym Etiquette Rules You Should Follow</h1>
        <p>Whether you are a frequent gym-goer or you just started working out at your local community center, there are
            a few does and you are probably aware of. For example, you likely know you should wipe down equipment when
            you are done with it and avoid hogging a machine when you see someone waiting patiently. </p>
    </div>
    <h1>1. Dress for success.</h1>
    <div class="photo1">

    </div>
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>100% cotton clothes. Even though it may stink less than synthetic fabrics, cotton absorbs all of your
            sweat—which may lead to bacterial growth. Instead, try sweat-wicking materials like spandex and polyester.
        </li>
        <li>Worn-out sneakers. As tennis shoes get older and lose tread, they provide less shock absorption and can
            impact the alignment of your feet, knees, and hips. If the designs on the bottom of your shoes are wearing
            off, it’s time for a new pair.</li>
        <li>Rings. Wearing jewelry while you lift can cause an injury if you lose your grip on the weights, or the iron
            bar might scratch the metal or stone of your ring. Leave your jewelry in the locker room or at home, or try
            wearing a silicon ring to the gym.</li>
        <li>Ill-fitting clothes. Too-tight gear can cause chafing, leg cramps, or even breathing difficulty. On the
            other hand, baggy clothes can get in the way while you’re running or lifting. Find a middle ground: workout
            clothes that fit and flatter you. </li>

        <h1>2. Get to class on time.</h1>
        <div class="photo2">

        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Group fitness classes are a great way to meet people at the gym or connect with the community you
                already have there. It’s good manners to arrive on time (and better manners if you can be there early!).
            </li>
            <li>We suggest skipping classes like restorative yoga if you think you’ll be late; you’ll probably disrupt
                the quiet atmosphere of the group if you come in 10 minutes after it starts. But if you’re late to a
                cardio class, you can quickly sneak in the back and set up quietly before catching up with the others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h1>3. Respect the machines.</h1>
        <div class="photo3">
            <img src="https://lafayettefamilyymca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/24381958_s.jpg" alt="">
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Before hopping on the treadmill or picking up those weights, check to make sure the equipment is free. If not, ask if you can “work in” with someone, which means trading off sets of cardio or free weights with the other person. But if the other gym-goer is almost finished, he or she may decline your request to work in. Just be patient and give them space until they’re ready to pass the machine or weights off to you.</li>
            <li>When you’re using the gym equipment, it’s important to remember that—like you—other people are working out on a tight schedule. So, if you need to use the restroom or grab a drink, drape your towel over the machine and come back quickly (after a minute or two, not 10). And once you’ve finished with the machine, move on. Sitting on equipment you’re not using to text, scroll social media, or take the perfect selfie is disrespectful to the people waiting on you.

        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>4. Give people personal space.</h1>
    <div class="photo4">
        <img src="https://lafayettefamilyymca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/34171191_s.jpg" alt="">
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Gyms can get busy, but it’s polite to give other gym-goers as much space as you can. Try not to get on a bike or treadmill right next to someone if other machines are open. If you do have to squeeze in your cardio next to another person, keep your eyes on your own machine, TV screen, and workout stats. Your neighbor doesn’t want you watching over his or her shoulder!</li>
        <li>Similar gym etiquette rules apply in the weight room: Keep a wide berth around the heavy lifters to keep them (and yourself) safe. You also want to stay out of their line of sight; while this may seem counterintuitive, it’s distracting to weightlifters when they notice someone close to their bench or bar.And regardless of where you are, don’t flirt with others who are trying to exercise.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
<h1>5. Avoid making calls, and use headphones.</h1>
<div class="photo5">

</div>
<ul>
    <li>Using your phone for anything other than music at the gym can be pretty disruptive to others. That’s why you shouldn’t make any calls—or keep them in the lobby, locker room, or community area. If you do have to take a call, try using headphones and excusing yourself from the crowded cardio or weights room. </li>
    <li>Speaking of headphones, you should use these whenever you listen to music or stream a TV show during a workout. But it’s also important to pay attention to others who are wearing them; they may be intently focused on their exercise or jamming to loud workout tunes. For this reason, don’t startle or quickly approach someone with headphones in, even if you know them. You don’t want someone to lose control of their equipment just because you wanted to say hi.</li>
</ul>
<h1>7. Make friends, and only give advice when asked!</h1>
<div class="photo6">
    <img src="https://lafayettefamilyymca.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/35556111_s.jpg" alt="">
</div>
<ul>
    <li>It’s perfectly fine (and kind!) to introduce yourself to new members or people you keep running into or seeing at the gym. However, it’s important to only give these new friends workout advice if they ask you. Avoid telling them things like their form is wrong or they should be running faster; comments like these only make people feel judged and unwelcome.</li>
    <li>This also applies if someone gives you unsolicited advice. You can just nod politely and move on while continuing to exercise like you were before. If you still have issues with your well-intentioned neighbor, you can always ask a staff member for help. And if you’re unsure about any of these rules, or you’re looking for exercise or form-related tips, your gym’s staff is here to assist you!</li>
    <li> Now you’re ready to follow these gym etiquette rules—and you’re one step closer to reaching your fitness goals! But if you’re not sure where to start, don’t worry. A fitness coach or other staff member can provide tips for a great workout while helping you feel more at home.</li>
